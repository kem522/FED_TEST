## Comments

I used React and React Router to create the UI and navigation of the site, as I feel most comfortable with the library. I used Bulma for styling as it allowed me to quickly realise the design whilst being fully responsive across most browsers and devices.

This was the first time I had configured webpack and found that to be the most challenging part of the build. I used a number of different tutorials online plus starter code that I was given during my course at GA. Although I still don't fully understand how webpack works, I feel much more confident working with it on my own now.

Due to the ;time constraints I decided not to write tests since frontend testing was not covered in great depths on the course and I wanted to make sure I realised the designs fully in the time that I was given. Having said that I see the value of testing and am keen to learn more about it and TDD/BDD principals.
